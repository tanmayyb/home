Hi,

I'm an undergraduate in `Electrical Engineering` at TMU, Toronto with an expected degree date of August 2025. I'm presently on Professional Engineering Year (PEY) at `Advanced MicroDevices Inc. (AMD)` as a Software Solutions Engineering Intern till the end of April 2024.

My passion is grounded in the study, design, and engineering of all things intelligent. This has attracted me to fields such as `Robotics`, `Computational Neuroscience`, `Machine Learning`, and lately, `AI`. I have industry experience in `Robotics`, `ML Engineering`, and `Software Engineering`. My research interests lie in `Autonomous Vehicles`, `Robotics`, cool applications of ML, `BCIs`, and `Conciousness`.

I hope to one day generate significant contributions to these field.
