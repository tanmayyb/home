I am a 4th year Electrical Engineer in training at TMU (formerly Ryerson University). I am familiar with writing applications in Python, C/C++ and JavaScript for a variety of projects.

I am deeply interested in the areas of `Cognitive Robotics`, `Applied Machine Learning`, `Human-Robot Interaction`, and `Neuroinformatics`. 

My ethos is to put creativity and passion into my projects and take responsibility in team success by championing quality and proactive communication. Creative team culture is my passion and my obsession.
