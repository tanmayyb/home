I am an undergraduate researcher who is motivated by open problems in intelligence in `Robotics` and `EmbodiedAI` such as: optimal priors, perception, and efficient learning architectures. I’m interested in prior learning because we don’t know of any (natural) intelligence that does not already have priors. Is it possible to be ‘meaningfully’ intelligent without any priors? Moreover, we know that having the right priors is essential for learning efficiently.

Another area of personal study for me is the phenomenon of emergence in systems which imply consciousness or intelligence. I like this area of research because it demands a deep revision of our understanding about ourselves and the world. Lastly, I believe that we live in a very exciting time period in history where information processing can now be studied to shed new light on our ancient curiosities.


Presently, I work with [Dr. Luis Figueredo](https://www.luisfigueredo.com/) and [Dr. Tianyu Ren](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/TianyuRen) at [MIRMI](mirmi.tum.de/en/mirmi/home/) in the area of perception for Robotics. Our work focuses on perception for prior learning for novel motion planners that use geometric algebra and vector field heuristics.

Previously, I was involved in professional and academic research and development roles in Robotics, Machine Learning, and Computer Architecture at [AMD](https://amd.com), [UTMIST](https://utmist.gitlab.io), [AVL](https://www.torontomu.ca/autonomous-vehicles-lab/), and [TMR](https://www.instagram.com/torontometrobotics/?hl=en). Additionally, I’ve been a 3-time participant (student) in the NeuroMatch Academy Initiative which offers research-project based courses in Computational Neuroscience, Deep Learning, and NeuroAI. I recieved my B.E. in `Electrical Engineering` from [TMU, Toronto](torontomu.ca) in June of 2025.
