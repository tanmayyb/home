Hi, I'm a year-4 Electrical Engineering undergrad at TMU, Toronto. I'm currently on a PEY at Advanced MicroDevices Inc. (AMD) working as a Software Solutions (R&D) Engineering Intern to help AMD optimize power for next-gen APU software architectures.

My technical strong suits lie in developing algorithms, solutions, and systems in Python and C/C++ across diverse domains. I have industry experience in `Mobile Robotics`, `Machine Learning Engineering`, and `ASIC power optimization`. My research interests are in `Self-Driving Cars`, `Bio-inspired Robotics`, `Applied Machine Learning`, and `Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)`.

I'm presently seeking internships for Summer of 2024.
